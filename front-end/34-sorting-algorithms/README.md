## Outline
We all know how to use Javascript's `Array.prototype.sort` to sort an array by some numeric value. But how exactly does that get powered under the hood? Sorting alogrithms! We will use this class to learn the multiple sorting algorithms commonly used in computer science and their advantages and disadvantages.
