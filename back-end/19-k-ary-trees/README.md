===

## Learning Objectives
* Students will understand the k-ary tree data structure and how to traverse a k-ary tree with breadth-first traversal
* Students will understand how a queue can server as a helper data structure to achieve breadth-first traversal 
* Students will traverse a DOM on and convert DOM nodes into their own k-ary tree data structure

## Resources
* Read [Breaking Down Breadth-First Search](https://medium.com/basecs/breaking-down-breadth-first-search-cebe696709d9)


### What is a K-Ary Tree?
* A K-ary tree is a tree in which no node can have more than K children. Real life examples of K-ary trees are the DOM.
